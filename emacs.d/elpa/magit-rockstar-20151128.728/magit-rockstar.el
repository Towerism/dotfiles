;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides two commands which manipulate author and
;; committer dates.  You could use it to make yourself look like
;; a rockstar programmer who hammers out commits at one commit per
;; minute.  But the real purpose is to recover from heavy
;; re-arrangements of commits, that have causes the existing author
;; and committer dates to become meaningless.

;; I add these commands to the appropriate popups like this:
;;
;;    (magit-define-popup-action 'magit-rebase-popup
;;      ?R "Rockstar" 'magit-rockstar)
;;    (magit-define-popup-action 'magit-commit-popup
;;      ?n "Reshelve" 'magit-reshelve)

;; Also included are tools that are either only useful for people
;; working on Magit itself and/or that aren't ready to be added to
;; Magit yet.  These tools might change at any time, without prior
;; notice or way to appeal.  This is a staging ground.  It's okay
;; if things ain't perfect, or if they only do what *I currently*
;; need but not what you (or I) think they should (eventually) be
;; doing instead.

;; Currently my init file also contains this:
;;
;;    (magit-define-popup-action 'magit-fetch-popup
;;      ?p "Pull request" 'magit-branch-pull-request)
