This repo currently has configs for the following:
- emacs
- i3
- dunst
- kitty
- ncmpcpp
- polybar
- rofi
- wallpapers
- zsh
** Requirements
The following are assumed to be installed:
- prezto (for a pleasant zsh experience)
- i3wm
- polybar
- rofi (required by i3)
- acpi (required by i3blocks for battery indicator)
- feh (required for background)
- Font Awesome (required by polybar)
- Roboto font (required by polybar)
- sysstat (required by i3blocks for cpu usage)
- pacman-contrib (required by i3blocks for update checking)
- pulseaudio
- ponymix (used for pulseaudio volume control)
- pywal (used for tty colorscheme restoration)
- [[https://www.github.com/towerism/color-blend][color-blend]] (used for calculating colors)
** Optional
The following are optional:
- GNU Stow (recommended if you want to run the auto-install script)
- compton (optional for cool animations and transparency)
- Franz (for cloud services)
- Spotify
- playerctl (control media playback)
- kitty (preferred terminal)
** Usage
You may have to remove existing dotfiles if they are not already managed by GNU
stow. After cloning, running the install script will set up the symlinks for
you, as well as install the default theme:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ git clone https://github.com/towerism/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ ~/.dotfiles/install
#+END_SRC

*** Themes
This dotfile setup is designed to allow the user to change the theme on the fly.
Themes can be loaded randomly, or selectively, on the fly based on wallpapers
stored in .wallpapers folder. Use =Super+Shift+t= to load a random theme. Or use
the =~/.dotfiles/load-theme .wallpapers/<path>= to load a specific theme based
on the chosen wallpaper. Pywal is used to dynamically, and repeatably, create a
colorscheme based on the chosen wallpaper. The colorscheme will be applied to the
terminal, polybar, and dunst notifications.
** emacs
Emacs is configured by spacemacs.
*** .emacs.d
This is essentially a snapshot of Spacemacs. Updating this submodule will update
the Spacemacs emacs distribution.

*** .spacemacs.d
This is the configuration dotfile for Spacemacs. Any custom layers will go in here.
** i3
This is a modified version of the default config. Window navigation was modified
to mirror vim bindings exactly, so horizontal splitting had to be remapped. I've
also configured certain programs to open to certain workspaces, i.e. emacs open
in the code workspaces, and chromium opens in the www workspace. The
configuration also automatically loads the theme that was most recently loaded.
** dunst
Dunst is used for notifications. It hasn't been configured much from default
other than wider notification window. The configuration is generated when
changing themes in order to reflect the whatever the current colorscheme is.
** kitty
The kitty default configuration is sufficient for now. The only thing changed is
the default font.
** ncmpcpp
The chosen media player frontend. The configuration uses vim navigation style.
** polybar
This config shows a pretty status bar at the top of the screen. It shows
battery, storage capacity used, volume, memory and cpu usage, wifi, power menu,
and workspaces that are pinned to the corresponding monitor.
** rofi
The preferred application launchered. It is configured to match whatever the
current colorscheme is.
** wallpapers
Contains lockscreen-only wallpapers that don't work with pywal as well as the
wallpapers that can be used with wal. The random-theme script pulls wallpapers
from the wallpapers that are not lockscreen-only.
** zsh
This configuration automatically starts the emacs daemon and gives several
aliases to ~emacsclient -t~. It also provides good defaults through the prezto
zsh configuration framework, including fuzzy completion, and git integration.
