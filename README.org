* dotfiles
This repo currently has the following dotfiles:
- .zshrc
- .emacs.d
** .zshrc
The .zshrc assumes [[http://www.github.com/skwp/dotfiles][yadr]] is installed. It automatically starts the emacs daemon
and gives several aliases to ~emacsclient -t~.
** .emacs.d
The emacs configuration was inspired by [[http://www.github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]], which was my first foray
into emacs. However, Spacemacs was too bloated for me. Thus, I am essentially
taking my most commonly used features from Spacemacs and putting them into my
own config without all the extra bloat.
